        <p > 
          After deciding to pursue a career change into software development in early 2019, 
          I have become enthralled with the breadth of powerful new languages and libraries 
          that have come about just in the last ten years. 
          <br/><br/>

          Currently, I am all about React, TypeScript and CSS3.</p>

          <h3>Skills</h3>
          <p> JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS3, Adobe Photoshop, ProTools</p>

          <h3>Other Interests/Skills</h3>
          <p> Die Hard DIYer, Music Production, Construction, Brewing</p>
